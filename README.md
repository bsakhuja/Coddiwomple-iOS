### App Design

#### Objective
Coddiwomple means to "travel in a purposeful manner towards a vague destination." Coddiwomple is an app for organizing the places around us to make traveling easier.

#### Audience
This app is targeted at adults who love to travel both in nature and in cities.

#### Experience
The casual user will add places to their map and visit a handful of the places they've added.  They will plan trips and check their map to see if they've added anything on the way or at their destination.

The hardcore user will add places all over their map and create lists, trying to visit each place.
